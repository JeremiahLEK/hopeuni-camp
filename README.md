## About
A web platform to hopefully ease the communication between campers and the camp committee. With features for users to view and retrieve important information/announcement about the camp or their personal information regarding the camp (i.e. games group or workshop details), and also features for camp committees to easily update and diseminate important informations. 

## Demo Website 

We are working on it to give the camp committee a solid preview of how they can work with the system, but right now all I can provide is a detailed list of the features.

- Camper's View - `https://jeremiah-ang.github.io/hopeuni/`
- Camp Committee's View - `(WIP)`

## Features
- Announcements + Countdown + Schedule
	- One-stop location to get all important announcement/information regarding the camp as a whole (i.e. `change in plans`, `emergency contacts`) or individual component of a camp (i.e. `games attire`, `door opening time`)
	- Integrated platform for all camp committee to update informations/announcements
- Camper's info 
	- For campers to retrieve their information such as their `games group`, `room number`, `workshop number` or other important information.  
- Feedback/Testimonies/Thanks Giving
	- Similarly a one-stop location for anyone who wants to give thanks or to be encouraged by other fellow campers.

## How to contribute? 

We are no experts in this, but if you think you see potential in how this can contribute to the camp and really want to contribute to the application just let us know :) Below is a few ways I think you can contribute in. 

- Web designer
	- Task: The designer will design the `look and feel` and also the `user experience` of the webpage, the design should align with the camp's design.
	- Skillset: Comfortable with designing web pages and understands the limitations of web pages, coding skill not required but a plus
	
- Front-end developer
	- Task: You and another developer will develop the front-facing part of the website
	- Skillset: We don't currently have a framework we are dead fixed on, so I guess you just need to know html, css and javascript
	
## Tech Stack

- Angular 6
- Hosted on github pages, so all 'backend' process (i.e. validations) will be on client side (LOL) 
- We'll use google sheet as database
